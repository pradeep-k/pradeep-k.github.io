I joined the Department of Computer Science, William & Mary (The second oldest university in the USA, and the public Ivy) in the Fall 2019 as an Assistant Professor. I completed my PhD in Computer Engineering at the George Washington University (GWU). My research interest is at the intersection of Data Science and Cyber-infrastructure, developing an eco-system to plug the emerging storage and compute hardwares in the system software stack of data analytics. This roughly translates to IO, File and Storage Systems, Memory sub-system, Data Management, and High-Performance Data Analytics with a focus on emerging Big Data applications such as Graph Processing, Stream Analytics, Machine Learning etc. I completed my Bachelor of Technology degree from Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad, India in the year 2007.
